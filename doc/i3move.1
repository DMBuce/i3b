If the active window is tiled, i3move will move it with
\fIi3\-msg move <direction>\fP instead.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\fB\-t, \-\-title\fP <size> \~ \~ (default: \f(CR26\fP)
.RS 4
The size of i3\(cqs window title bars in pixels. Or, if title bars are
disabled, the size of the top window border.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-b, \-\-border\fP <size> \~ \~ (default: \f(CR3\fP)
.RS 4
The size of i3\(cqs bottom, left, and right window borders in pixels.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-m, \-\-margins\fP <top> [bottom] [left] [right] \~ \~ (default: \f(CR0 0 0 0\fP)
.RS 4
The width of margins along the top, bottom, left, and right sides of
the screen.
.sp
If the window is inside the margins, its movement is determined by
\fI\-\-inside\-distance\fP. Otherwise, its movement is determined by
\fI\-\-outside\-distance\fP. See the description of those options for
details.
.sp
The margins can also be used to prevent floating windows from
overlapping i3bar and/or the gaps around the edge of the screen. See
the description of the \fI\-\-snap\fP and \fI\-\-clamp\fP options for details.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-i, \-\-inside\-distance\fP <distance> \~ \~ (default: \f(CRw\fP)
.RS 4
The distance to move the window when it\(cqs inside the margins.
See the DISTANCE section for the format of \fIdistance\fP.
.sp
This option is ignored and set to \f(CR2\fP if \fIdirection\fP is
\f(CRtop\fP, \f(CRbottom\fP, \f(CRport\fP, \f(CRstarboard\fP, \f(CRnorth\fP, \f(CRsouth\fP, \f(CReast\fP, or \f(CRwest\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-o, \-\-outside\-distance\fP <distance> \~ \~ (default: \f(CR\-17px\fP)
.RS 4
The distance to move the window when it\(cqs overlapping the margins.
The format for \fIdistance\fP is the same as for \fI\-\-inside\-distance\fP. See
that option for details.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-s, \-\-small\-distance\fP <distance> \~ \~ (default: \f(CR=\fP)
.RS 4
The distance to move small windows. A window is considered small if
its size is less than the \fI\-\-threshold\fP option\(cqs value.
.sp
This option has no effect unless \fI\-\-inside\-distance\fP or
\fI\-\-outside\-distance\fP is \f(CRw\fP.
.sp
The format for \fIdistance\fP is the same as for \fI\-\-inside\-distance\fP, except
that it can\(cqt be \f(CRw\fP. See the description of that option for
details.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-l, \-\-large\-distance\fP <distance> \~ \~ (default: \f(CR3\fP)
.RS 4
The distance to move large windows. A window is considered large if
its size is greater than or equal to the \fI\-\-threshold\fP option\(cqs value.
.sp
This option has no effect unless \fI\-\-inside\-distance\fP or
\fI\-\-outside\-distance\fP is \f(CRw\fP.
.sp
The format for \fIdistance\fP is the same as for \fI\-\-inside\-distance\fP, except
that it can\(cqt be \f(CRw\fP. See that option for details.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-T, \-\-threshold\fP <threshold> \~ \~ (default: \f(CR33%%\fP)
.RS 4
The window size threshold. \fIthreshold\fP must be an integer. An optional
suffix of \f(CRpx\fP or \f(CR%%\fP may be used. With \f(CR%%\fP, \fIthreshold\fP is measured
as a percentage of the window\(cqs size. Otherwise, it\(cqs measured in
pixels.
.sp
If the threshold computed is negative, the difference between it and
the window\(cqs size is used.
.sp
The threshold interacts with the \fI\-\-small\-distance\fP, \fI\-\-large\-distance\fP,
\fI\-\-inside\-distance\fP, and \fI\-\-outside\-distance\fP options to determine the
distance to move. See the description of those options for details.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-C, \-\-clamp\fP
.RS 4
Constrain the window\(cqs movement so that it does not overlap the
margins. A window that already overlaps can be moved normally.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-clamp\fP
.RS 4
Disable \fI\-\-clamp\fP. This is the default behavior.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-S, \-\-snap\fP
.RS 4
When the window encounters a margin, snap it to the margin\(cqs edge.
Once snapped, a window can be moved past a margin normally. This is
the default behavior.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-snap\fP
.RS 4
Disable \fI\-\-snap\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-H, \-\-hide\fP
.RS 4
When moved towards the edge of the screen while snapped to a margin,
hide the window past the edge of the screen by a distance determined
by \fI\-\-outside\-distance\fP. This is the default behavior. Once hidden, a
window moved towards the center of the screen will be snapped to the
margin.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-hide\fP
.RS 4
Disable \fI\-\-hide\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-M, \-\-compound\-display\fP
.RS 4
Treat each monitor separately. Compute distances and positions with
respect to the monitor that contains the active window. With \fI\-\-snap\fP
enabled, when a window that is snapped to a margin is moved towards
an adjacent monitor, it will snap to that monitor\(cqs nearest margin.
.sp
This is the default behavior.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-compound\-display\fP
.RS 4
Disable \fI\-\-compound\-display\fP and treat multiple monitors as one big
monitor.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-P, \-\-passthru\fP
.RS 4
If the active window is tiled, use \fIi3\-msg\fP to move it. This is the
default behavior.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-passthru\fP
.RS 4
Disable \fI\-\-passthru\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-gen\fP
.RS 4
Try to generate sane defaults for the \fI\-\-title\fP, \fI\-\-border\fP, and
\fI\-\-margins\fP options, then exit. The output of this command can be set
in \f(CR$HOME/.config/i3move\fP or the \f(CR$I3MOVE_OPTIONS\fP environment
variable.
.sp
i3move guesses the title, border, and margin sizes by reading the i3
config, opening a new workspace named "tmp.i3move", launching
\fIi3\-sensible\-terminal\fP, then manipulating the terminal in order to
measure the window borders, window title, bar size, and gap sizes.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-man\fP

.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-help\fP

.SH "DISTANCE"
.sp
The distances provided to the \fI\-\-inside\-distance\fP, \fI\-\-outside\-distance\fP,
\fI\-\-small\-distance\fP, and \fI\-\-large\-distance\fP options must be one of the
following.
.sp
<
.RS 4
Choose a distance such that (1) a window on the edge of a margin
will be aligned to the opposite margin after being moved several
times by i3move, and (2) the distance chosen is smaller than the
window\(cqs size while being as large as possible.
.RE
.sp
>
.RS 4
Like \fI<\fP except that the distance chosen is larger than the
window\(cqs size while being as small as possible.
.RE
.sp
=
.RS 4
A combination of \fI<\fP and \fI>\fP. If the distance given by \fI<\fP is
such that a window on the edge of a margin would be centered
after being moved an odd number of times by i3move, that distance is
used. Otherwise, the distance given by \fI>\fP is used.
.RE
.sp
\fIN\fP[px|%|%%]
.RS 4
\fIN\fP must be an integer.
.sp
An optional suffix may be provided. If a suffix of \f(CRpx\fP is used,
\fIN\fP is measured in pixels. If a suffix of \f(CR%\fP is used, \fIN\fP is
measured as a percentage of the window\(cqs size. If a suffix of
\f(CR%%\fP is used, \fIN\fP is measured as a percentage of the screen\(cqs
size.
.sp
With no suffix, the distance is chosen such that, when moved by
successive i3move commands, a window at the edge of a margin
will occupy \fIN\fP equally spaced positions, and the final position
will be aligned to the opposite margin.
.sp
If the distance computed is negative, the difference between it
and the window\(cqs size is used.
.RE
.sp
w
.RS 4
Use the window\(cqs size to determine the distance to move. If the
window is smaller than the size given by the \fI\-\-threshold\fP option,
then use the \fI\-\-small\-distance\fP option\(cqs value. Otherwise, use the
\fI\-\-large\-distance\fP option\(cqs value.
