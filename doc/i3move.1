\&\fB\-t, \-\-title\fR \s-1SIZE\s0
.Sp
.RS 4
The size of i3's window title bars in pixels.
Or, if title bars are disabled,
the size of the top window border.
.Sp
Default: 26
.RE
.PP
\&\fB\-b, \-\-border\fR \s-1SIZE\s0

.RE
.PP
\&\fB\-m, \-\-margins\fR \s-1TOP\s0 [\s-1BOTTOM\s0] [\s-1LEFT\s0] [\s-1RIGHT\s0]
.Sp
.RS 4
The width of margins along the top, bottom, left,
and right sides of the screen.
.Sp
If the window is inside the margins,
its movement is determined by \fB\-\-inside\-distance\fR.
Otherwise, its movement is determined by \fB\-\-outside\-distance\fR.
See the description of those options for details.
.Sp
The margins can also be used to prevent floating windows
from overlapping i3bar and/or the gaps around the edge of the screen.
See the description of the \fB\-\-snap\fR and \fB\-\-clamp\fR options for details.
.Sp
Default: 0 0 0 0
.RE
.PP
\&\fB\-i, \-\-inside\-distance\fR \s-1DISTANCE\s0
.Sp

The distance to move the window when it's inside the margins.
\&\s-1DISTANCE\s0 can be one of the following.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`<\*(C'\fR
.Sp
.RS 4
Choose a distance such that
(1) a window on the edge of a margin will be aligned to the opposite margin
after being moved several times by i3move, and
(2) the distance chosen is smaller than the window's size
while being as large as possible.
.RE
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`>\*(C'\fR

while being as small as possible.
.RE

.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR
.Sp
.RS 4
A combination of \f(CW\*(C`<\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`>\*(C'\fR.
If the distance given by \f(CW\*(C`<\*(C'\fR is such that
a window on the edge of a margin would be centered
after being moved several times by i3move,
that distance is used.
Otherwise, the distance given by \f(CW\*(C`>\*(C'\fR is used.
.RE
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
\&\fIN\fR[px|%|%%]
.Sp
.RS 4
\&\fIN\fR must be an integer.
.Sp
An optional suffix may be provided.
If a suffix of 'px' is used,
\&\fIN\fR is measured in pixels.
If a suffix of '%' is used,
\&\fIN\fR is measured as a percentage of the window's size.
If a suffix of '%%' is used,
\&\fIN\fR is measured as a percentage of the screen's size.
.Sp
With no suffix,
the distance is chosen such that,
when moved by successive i3move commands,
a window at the edge of a margin will occupy \fIN\fR equally spaced positions,
and the final position will be aligned to the opposite margin.
.Sp
If the distance computed is negative,
the difference between it and the window's size is used.
.RE
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`w\*(C'\fR
.Sp
.RS 4
Use the window's size to determine the distance to move.
If the window is smaller than the size given by the \fB\-\-threshold\fR option,
then use the \fB\-\-small\-distance\fR option's value.
Otherwise, use the \fB\-\-large\-distance\fR option's value.
.RE

.RE

\&\fB\-o, \-\-outside\-distance\fR \s-1DISTANCE\s0
.Sp
.RS 4
The distance to move the window when it's overlapping the margins.
The format for \s-1DISTANCE\s0 is the same as for \fB\-\-inside\-distance\fR.
See that option for details.
.Sp
Default: \-17px
.RE
.PP
\&\fB\-s, \-\-small\-distance\fR \s-1DISTANCE\s0
.Sp
.RS 4
The distance to move small windows.
A window is considered small if its size is less than
the \fB\-\-threshold\fR option's value.
.Sp
This option has no effect unless
\&\fB\-\-inside\-distance\fR or \fB\-\-outside\-distance\fR is \f(CW\*(C`w\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
The format for \s-1DISTANCE\s0 is the same as for \fB\-\-inside\-distance\fR,

See the description of that option for details.
.Sp
Default: =
.RE
.PP
\&\fB\-l, \-\-large\-distance\fR \s-1DISTANCE\s0
.Sp
.RS 4
The distance to move large windows.
A window is considered large if its size is greater than or equal to
the \fB\-\-threshold\fR option's value.
.Sp
This option has no effect unless
\&\fB\-\-inside\-distance\fR or \fB\-\-outside\-distance\fR is \f(CW\*(C`w\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
The format for \s-1DISTANCE\s0 is the same as for \fB\-\-inside\-distance\fR,

See that option for details.
.Sp
Default: 3
.RE
.PP
\&\fB\-T, \-\-threshold\fR \s-1THRESHOLD\s0
.Sp
.RS 4
The window size threshold.
\&\s-1THRESHOLD\s0 must be an integer.
An optional suffix of 'px' or '%%' may be used.
With '%%', \s-1THRESHOLD\s0 is measured as a percentage of the window's size.
Otherwise, it's measured in pixels.
.Sp
If the threshold computed is negative,
the difference between it and the window's size is used.
.Sp
The threshold interacts with the \fB\-\-small\-distance\fR, \fB\-\-large\-distance\fR,
\&\fB\-\-inside\-distance\fR, and \fB\-\-outside\-distance\fR options
to determine the distance to move.
See the description of those options for details.
.Sp
Default: 33%%
.RE

.Sp
.RS 4
When moved towards the edge of the screen
while snapped to a margin,
hide the window past the edge of the screen
by a distance determined by \fB\-\-outside\-distance\fR.
This is the default behavior.
Once hidden, a window moved towards the center of the screen
will be snapped to the margin.
.RE

.Sp
.RS 4
Disable \fB\-\-hide\fR.
.RE

.RS 4
Treat each monitor separately.
Compute distances and positions with respect to
the monitor that contains the active window.
With \fB\-\-snap\fR enabled,
when a window that is snapped to a margin is moved towards an adjacent monitor,
it will snap to that monitor's nearest margin.
.Sp
This is the default behavior.
