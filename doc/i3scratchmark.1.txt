./bin/i3scratchmark: illegal option -- -
Usage: i3scratchmark [-s] [-m MARK] [-c COMMAND] [-i I3_COMMAND]

    Toggle between showing and hiding the scratchpad window marked with
    MARK. If no such window exists and the active window is floating,
    mark it with MARK, run I3_COMMAND, and send it to the scratchpad.
    Otherwise, if COMMAND is not 'none', run COMMAND, wait for the next
    window to launch, mark it with MARK, run I3_COMMAND, and place it
    in the scratchpad without losing focus.

    If MARK is 'cycle', flip through scratchpad windows instead.

    With -s, make new scratchpad windows sticky.

    By default, MARK is 'cycle', COMMAND is 'i3-sensible-terminal',
    and I3_COMMAND is ''.

Example Config:

    bindsym $mod+period exec i3scratchmark -m scratch -s -c urxvt
    bindsym $mod+Mod1+period exec i3scratchmark -m itch -s -c none
    bindsym $mod+comma exec i3scratchmark
    bindsym $mod+Mod1+comma move scratchpad
