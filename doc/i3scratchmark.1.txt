i3scratchmark(1)
================

Name
----

i3scratchmark - Flip through scratchpad windows.

Synopsis
--------

'i3scratchmark' [-s] [-m <mark>] [-c <command>] [-i <i3-command>]

Description
-----------

By default, 'i3scratchmark' flips through scratchpad windows. With `-m`, it
toggles between showing and hiding a marked scratchpad window.

Options
-------

**-m** <mark> {nbsp} {nbsp} (default: 'cycle')::
	If 'mark' is `cycle`, flip through scratchpad windows. This is the default
	behavior.
+
Otherwise, toggle between showing and hiding the scratchpad window marked with
'mark'.
+
If no such window exists and the active window is floating, mark it with
'mark' and send it to the scratchpad.
+
Otherwise, run the command specified by the '-c' option,
mark the next launched window with 'mark', and send it to the scratchpad.

**-c** <command> {nbsp} {nbsp} (default: 'i3-sensible-terminal')::
	The command to run if no 'mark' exists for the '-m' option and the active
	window is tiled.
+
Note that if the command does not create a new window, the '-m' option will
send whatever window is created next to the scratchpad, which is usually
not what you want.

**-i** <i3-command> {nbsp} {nbsp} (default: '')::
	An 'i3' command to run after the '-m' option marks a window.
	Can be specified multiple times.

**-s**::
	Equivalent to `-i 'sticky enable'`. Makes newly marked windows sticky.

--------
