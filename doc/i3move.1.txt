    directions:

        up|down|left|right

        top|bottom|port|starboard or north|south|east|west

DESCRIPTION
    Move a floating i3 window up, down, left, or right. The distance moved
    is chosen based on the window's size and position.

    Several aliases are provided for convenience.

        top, north: Alias for "--inside-direction 2 up"

        bottom, south: Alias for "--inside-direction 2 down"

        port, west: Alias for "--inside-direction 2 left"

        starboard, east: Alias for "--inside-direction 2 right"

    If the active window is tiled, i3move will move it with "i3-msg move
    DIRECTION" instead.

OPTIONS
    -t, --title SIZE

        The size of i3's window title bars in pixels. Or, if title bars are
        disabled, the size of the top window border.

        Default: 26

    -b, --border SIZE

        The size of i3's bottom, left, and right window borders in pixels.

        Default: 3

    -m, --margins TOP [BOTTOM] [LEFT] [RIGHT]

        The width of margins along the top, bottom, left, and right sides of
        the screen.

        If the window is inside the margins, its movement is determined by
        --inside-distance. Otherwise, its movement is determined by
        --outside-distance. See the description of those options for
        details.

        The margins can also be used to prevent floating windows from
        overlapping i3bar and/or the gaps around the edge of the screen. See
        the description of the --snap and --clamp options for details.

        Default: 0 0 0 0

    -i, --inside-distance DISTANCE

        The distance to move the window when it's inside the margins.
        DISTANCE can be one of the following.

        "<"

            Choose a distance such that (1) a window on the edge of a margin
            will be aligned to the opposite margin after being moved several
            times by i3move, and (2) the distance chosen is smaller than the
            window's size while being as large as possible.

        ">"

            Like "<" except that the distance chosen is larger than the
            window's size while being as small as possible.

        "="

            A combination of "<" and ">". If the distance given by "<" is
            such that a window on the edge of a margin would be centered
            after being moved several times by i3move, that distance is
            used. Otherwise, the distance given by ">" is used.

        *N*[px|%|%%]

            *N* must be an integer.

            An optional suffix may be provided. If a suffix of 'px' is used,
            *N* is measured in pixels. If a suffix of '%' is used, *N* is
            measured as a percentage of the window's size. If a suffix of
            '%%' is used, *N* is measured as a percentage of the screen's
            size.

            With no suffix, the distance is chosen such that, when moved by
            successive i3move commands, a window at the edge of a margin
            will occupy *N* equally spaced positions, and the final position
            will be aligned to the opposite margin.

            If the distance computed is negative, the difference between it
            and the window's size is used.

        "w"

            Use the window's size to determine the distance to move. If the
            window is smaller than the size given by the --threshold option,
            then use the --small-distance option's value. Otherwise, use the
            --large-distance option's value.

        This option is ignored and set to 2 if *direction* is one of: top,
        bottom, port, starboard, north, south, east, or west.

        Default: w

    -o, --outside-distance DISTANCE

        The distance to move the window when it's overlapping the margins.
        The format for DISTANCE is the same as for --inside-distance. See
        that option for details.

        Default: -17px

    -s, --small-distance DISTANCE

        The distance to move small windows. A window is considered small if
        its size is less than the --threshold option's value.

        This option has no effect unless --inside-distance or
        --outside-distance is "w".

        The format for DISTANCE is the same as for --inside-distance, except
        that it can't be "w". See the description of that option for
        details.

        Default: =

    -l, --large-distance DISTANCE

        The distance to move large windows. A window is considered large if
        its size is greater than or equal to the --threshold option's value.

        This option has no effect unless --inside-distance or
        --outside-distance is "w".

        The format for DISTANCE is the same as for --inside-distance, except
        that it can't be "w". See that option for details.

        Default: 3

    -T, --threshold THRESHOLD

        The window size threshold. THRESHOLD must be an integer. An optional
        suffix of 'px' or '%%' may be used. With '%%', THRESHOLD is measured
        as a percentage of the window's size. Otherwise, it's measured in
        pixels.

        If the threshold computed is negative, the difference between it and
        the window's size is used.

        The threshold interacts with the --small-distance, --large-distance,
        --inside-distance, and --outside-distance options to determine the
        distance to move. See the description of those options for details.

        Default: 33%%

    -C, --clamp

        Constrain the window's movement so that it does not overlap the
        margins. A window that already overlaps can be moved normally.

    --no-clamp

        Disable --clamp. This is the default behavior.

    -S, --snap

        When the window encounters a margin, snap it to the margin's edge.
        Once snapped, a window can be moved past a margin normally. This is
        the default behavior.

    --no-snap

        Disable --snap.

    -H, --hide

        When moved towards the edge of the screen while snapped to a margin,
        hide the window past the edge of the screen by a distance determined
        by --outside-distance. This is the default behavior. Once hidden, a
        window moved towards the center of the screen will be snapped to the
        margin.

    --no-hide

        Disable --hide.

    -M, --compound-display

        Treat each monitor separately. Compute distances and positions with
        respect to the monitor that contains the active window. With --snap
        enabled, when a window that is snapped to a margin is moved towards
        an adjacent monitor, it will snap to that monitor's nearest margin.

        This is the default behavior.

    --no-compound-display

        Disable --compound-display and treat multiple monitors as one big
        monitor.

    -P, --passthru

        If the active window is tiled, use "i3-msg" to move it. This is the
        default behavior.

    --no-passthru

        Disable --passthru.

    --gen

        Try to generate sane defaults for the --title, --border, and
        --margins options, then exit. The output of this command can be set
        in "$HOME/.config/i3move" or the $I3MOVE_OPTIONS environment
        variable.

        i3move guesses the title, border, and margin sizes by reading the i3
        config, opening a new workspace named "tmp.i3move", launching
        "i3-sensible-terminal", then manipulating the terminal in order to
        measure the window borders, window title, bar size, and gap sizes.

    --man

        Print the manual and exit.

    --help

        Print a help message and exit.

CONFIGURATION
    In addition to being passed on the command line, options are read from
    the following locations, with later options overriding earlier ones.

        "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/i3move"

        "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/i3/move"

        "$HOME/.i3move"

        $I3MOVE_OPTIONS environment variable

    If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not defined, it defaults to "$HOME/.config" .

EXAMPLES
    Create or reset i3move's config with sane defaults

        i3move --gen > ~/.config/i3move

    If i3move does not snap windows to the bar or gaps correctly, try
    tweaking the --title, --border, and/or --margins options in the config.
    See the description of those options for details. For best results, open
    a screenshot with an image editor such as kolourpaint to determine the
    correct values for these options.

    Move a floating window left, down, up, and right.

        i3move left
        i3move down
        i3move up
        i3move right

    Bind the commands above in i3's config

        bindsym $mod+Mod1+h exec i3move left
        bindsym $mod+Mod1+j exec i3move down
        bindsym $mod+Mod1+k exec i3move up
        bindsym $mod+Mod1+l exec i3move right

    After reloading i3 with the above config, you can move windows with
    i3move by holding down $mod+Alt and using vim keys ("hjkl").
