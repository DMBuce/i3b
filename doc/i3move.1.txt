Description
-----------

Move a floating i3 window up, down, left, or right. The distance moved
is chosen based on the window's size and position. Valid values for
'direction' are

* **up, down, left,** or **right**
* **top, north**: Equivalent to '--inside-distance 2 up'
* **bottom, south**: Equivalent to '--inside-distance 2 down'
* **port, west**: Equivalent to '--inside-distance 2 left'
* **starboard, east**: Equivalent to '--inside-distance 2 right'

If the active window is tiled, i3move will move it with
'i3-msg move <direction>' instead.

Options
-------
**-t, --title** <size> {nbsp} {nbsp} (default: `26`)::
	The size of i3's window title bars in pixels. Or, if title bars are
	disabled, the size of the top window border.

**-b, --border** <size> {nbsp} {nbsp} (default: `3`)::
	The size of i3's bottom, left, and right window borders in pixels.

**-m, --margins** <top> [bottom] [left] [right] {nbsp} {nbsp} (default: `0 0 0 0`)::
	The width of margins along the top, bottom, left, and right sides of
	the screen.
+
If the window is inside the margins, its movement is determined by
'--inside-distance'. Otherwise, its movement is determined by
'--outside-distance'. See the description of those options for
details.
+
The margins can also be used to prevent floating windows from
overlapping i3bar and/or the gaps around the edge of the screen. See
the description of the '--snap' and '--clamp' options for details.

**-i, --inside-distance** <distance> {nbsp} {nbsp} (default: `w`)::
	The distance to move the window when it's inside the margins.
	See the <<Distance,Distance>> section for the format of 'distance'.
+
This option is ignored and set to `2` if 'direction' is
`top`, `bottom`, `port`, `starboard`, `north`, `south`, `east`, or `west`.

**-o, --outside-distance** <distance> {nbsp} {nbsp} (default: `-17px`)::
	The distance to move the window when it's overlapping the margins.
	The format for 'distance' is the same as for '--inside-distance'. See
	that option for details.

**-s, --small-distance** <distance> {nbsp} {nbsp} (default: `=`)::
	The distance to move small windows. A window is considered small if
	its size is less than the '--threshold' option's value.
+
This option has no effect unless '--inside-distance' or
'--outside-distance' is `w`.
+
The format for 'distance' is the same as for '--inside-distance', except
that it can't be `w`. See the description of that option for
details.

**-l, --large-distance** <distance> {nbsp} {nbsp} (default: `3`)::
	The distance to move large windows. A window is considered large if
	its size is greater than or equal to the '--threshold' option's value.
+
This option has no effect unless '--inside-distance' or
'--outside-distance' is `w`.
+
The format for 'distance' is the same as for '--inside-distance', except
that it can't be `w`. See that option for details.

**-T, --threshold** <threshold> {nbsp} {nbsp} (default: `33%%`)::
	The window size threshold. 'threshold' must be an integer. An optional
	suffix of `px` or `%%` may be used. With `%%`, 'threshold' is measured
	as a percentage of the window's size. Otherwise, it's measured in
	pixels.
+
If the threshold computed is negative, the difference between it and
the window's size is used.
+
The threshold interacts with the '--small-distance', '--large-distance',
'--inside-distance', and '--outside-distance' options to determine the
distance to move. See the description of those options for details.

**-C, --clamp**::
	Constrain the window's movement so that it does not overlap the
	margins. A window that already overlaps can be moved normally.

**--no-clamp**::
	Disable '--clamp'. This is the default behavior.

**-S, --snap**::
	When the window encounters a margin, snap it to the margin's edge.
	Once snapped, a window can be moved past a margin normally. This is
	the default behavior.

**--no-snap**::
	Disable '--snap'.

**-H, --hide**::
	When moved towards the edge of the screen while snapped to a margin,
	hide the window past the edge of the screen by a distance determined
	by '--outside-distance'. This is the default behavior. Once hidden, a
	window moved towards the center of the screen will be snapped to the
	margin.

**--no-hide**::
	Disable '--hide'.

**-M, --compound-display**::
	Treat each monitor separately. Compute distances and positions with
	respect to the monitor that contains the active window. With '--snap'
	enabled, when a window that is snapped to a margin is moved towards
	an adjacent monitor, it will snap to that monitor's nearest margin.
+
This is the default behavior.

**--no-compound-display**::
	Disable '--compound-display' and treat multiple monitors as one big
	monitor.

**-P, --passthru**::
	If the active window is tiled, use 'i3-msg' to move it. This is the
	default behavior.

**--no-passthru**::
	Disable '--passthru'.

**--gen**::
	Try to generate sane defaults for the '--title', '--border', and
	'--margins' options, then exit. The output of this command can be set
	in `$HOME/.config/i3move` or the `$I3MOVE_OPTIONS` environment
	variable.
+
i3move guesses the title, border, and margin sizes by reading the i3
config, opening a new workspace named "tmp.i3move", launching
'i3-sensible-terminal', then manipulating the terminal in order to
measure the window borders, window title, bar size, and gap sizes.

**--man**::
	Print the manual and exit.

**--help**::
	Print a help message and exit.

Distance[[Distance]]
--------------------

The distances provided to the '--inside-distance', '--outside-distance',
'--small-distance', and '--large-distance' options must be one of the
following.

<::
	Choose a distance such that (1) a window on the edge of a margin
	will be aligned to the opposite margin after being moved several
	times by i3move, and (2) the distance chosen is smaller than the
	window's size while being as large as possible.

>::
	Like '<' except that the distance chosen is larger than the
	window's size while being as small as possible.

=::
A combination of '<' and '>'. If the distance given by '<' is
	such that a window on the edge of a margin would be centered
	after being moved an odd number of times by i3move, that distance is
	used. Otherwise, the distance given by '>' is used.

'N'[px|%|%%]::
    'N' must be an integer.
+
An optional suffix may be provided. If a suffix of `px` is used,
'N' is measured in pixels. If a suffix of `%` is used, 'N' is
measured as a percentage of the window's size. If a suffix of
`%%` is used, 'N' is measured as a percentage of the screen's
size.
+
With no suffix, the distance is chosen such that, when moved by
successive i3move commands, a window at the edge of a margin
will occupy 'N' equally spaced positions, and the final position
will be aligned to the opposite margin.
+
If the distance computed is negative, the difference between it
and the window's size is used.

w::
Use the window's size to determine the distance to move. If the
	window is smaller than the size given by the '--threshold' option,
	then use the '--small-distance' option's value. Otherwise, use the
	'--large-distance' option's value.

Configuration
-------------
In addition to being passed on the command line, options are read from
the following locations, with later options overriding earlier ones.

* `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/i3move`
* `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/i3/move`
* `$HOME/.i3move`
* The `$I3MOVE_OPTIONS` environment variable

If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not defined, it defaults to `$HOME/.config` .

Examples
--------
Create or reset i3move's config with sane defaults

 i3move --gen > ~/.config/i3move

If i3move does not snap windows to the bar or gaps correctly, try
tweaking the '--title', '--border', and/or '--margins' options in the config.
See the description of those options for details. For best results, open
a screenshot with an image editor such as kolourpaint to determine the
correct values for these options.

Move a floating window left, down, up, and right.

 i3move left
 i3move down
 i3move up
 i3move right

Bind the commands above in i3's config

 bindsym $mod+Mod1+h exec i3move left
 bindsym $mod+Mod1+j exec i3move down
 bindsym $mod+Mod1+k exec i3move up
 bindsym $mod+Mod1+l exec i3move right

After reloading i3 with the above config, you can move windows with
i3move by holding down $mod+Alt and using vim-like "hjkl" keys.
