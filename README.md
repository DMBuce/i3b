Requirements: perl, xwininfo, xdotool, xprop

See `pod2man $(which i3move) | man -l -` for extensive documentation.

## rofi-blezz

Run rofi's [blezz](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi-blezz) module
with a different start directory.
Similar to blezz's `-d` option,
this is a workaround for rofi's blezz module not having such functionality.
